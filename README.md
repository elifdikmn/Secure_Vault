Most hard drives are vulnerable to data leaks when they are physically captured. There are alternative solutions, such as BitLocker, that provide confidentiality by encrypting the entire drive. In this project, you are going to provide a solution to prevent data leaks. The project involves creating a "Secure File Vault" application that allows users to store sensitive files in an encrypted container

How to run the code:

-python3 -m venv venv

-source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the environment

-pip3 install pycryptodome

-pip install cryptography
